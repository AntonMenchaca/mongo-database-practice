A practice tool designed to cover setting up a mongo database and work with CRUD operations.

Learn the fundamentals of application structure and database integration by making a web app that renders generated images and text for a possible motivational poster. The user should be able to generate a poster by making requests to two separate api's. The user should then be able to create their own poster. They should also be allowed to use the randomly generated poster as a template. 

Basic functionality:

[ ] User should be able to generate a random poster by clicking the generate poster button. You should use the two provided api's to get a text and an image.

[ ] A user should be able to save a poster they created into the database.

[ ] Store your data in MongoDB (use mongoose npm to interact with MongoDB)

[ ] User should be given a list of all poster ids held within the database. They should be able to see any previously saved poster by using the find button.

[ ] User should be able to change the text of any poster before saving it. They should also be allowed to update previously made posters.

[ ] If a user tries to save a poster that has already once been saved to the database, they should be prompted to update the poster instead.

[ ] User should be able to delete any poster in the database. Create a button to handle this deletion. They should only be able to delete once they have first used the find button to search through the posters within the database.

Advanced/Extra:

[ ] Fix the styling in styles.css so that the text looks and is positioned more like the motivational cat poster!
